## 1. Download dataset
For downloading the different datasets it is sufficient to execute [script.sh](dataset/script.sh) as follows:
```bash
./script.sh dataset_links.txt  
```

If the script doesn't work you would have to change read, write and execute permissions as follows:
```bash
chmod 700 script.sh
```
